# Text Data Processing and Analysis: A Practical Guide to Natural Language Processing Techniques

## Research Question and Motivation

How can we effectively implement and utilize various text processing techniques to transform unstructured social media data into analyzable features while preserving semantic meaning and enabling sentiment analysis?

This research question addresses the practical challenges in processing social media text data, particularly:
1. Handling informal language and special characters in social media posts
2. Implementing efficient feature extraction methods
3. Developing a systematic approach to sentiment analysis
4. Creating reproducible text preprocessing pipelines

## Theory and Background

### Natural Language Processing Foundation
Text processing sits at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and data analysis. Our approach combines traditional NLP techniques with modern tools:

1. Text Preprocessing Methods:
   - Case normalization
   - Punctuation handling
   - Stop word removal
   - Tokenization

2. Feature Extraction Techniques:
   - Count-based methods (word count, character count)
   - Statistical methods (TF-IDF)
   - N-gram analysis
   - HashingVectorizer implementation

3. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Polarity detection
   - Subjectivity analysis
   - Emotion classification

### Statistical Methods in Text Analysis
The implementation leverages several statistical approaches:

1. Term Frequency (TF):
   ```python
   TF = (Number of times term T appears in document) / (Total terms in document)
   ```

2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):
   ```python
   IDF = log(Total number of documents / Number of documents containing term)
   ```

3. TF-IDF Score:
   ```python
   TF-IDF = TF × IDF
   ```

## Problem Statement

### Input Format
Raw social media text data containing:
```python
{
    'id': integer,
    'tweet': string,
    'label': integer (optional)
}
```

Example input:
```python
"@user when a father is dysfunctional and is so selfish"
```

### Output Format
Processed features including:
1. Basic metrics:
   - Word count
   - Character count
   - Average word length
   - Stop word count
   - Special character count

2. Advanced features:
   - TF-IDF vectors
   - N-gram representations
   - Sentiment scores

Example output:
```python
{
    'word_count': 21,
    'char_count': 102,
    'avg_word': 4.55,
    'stopwords': 10,
    'sentiment': -0.3
}
```

## Problem Analysis

### Implementation Constraints

1. Data Quality:
   - Handling Unicode characters
   - Managing special characters (#, @)
   - Processing emoticons and symbols
   - Dealing with informal language

2. Processing Requirements:
   - Efficient handling of large datasets
   - Memory optimization for vectorization
   - Scalable feature extraction

3. Accuracy Considerations:
   - Preserving semantic meaning
   - Maintaining sentiment context
   - Handling negations

### Solution Architecture

The implementation follows a modular pipeline:

1. Basic Feature Extraction:
   ```python
   def num_of_words(df):
       df['word_count'] = df['tweet'].apply(lambda x: len(str(x).split(" ")))
   ```

2. Text Cleaning:
   ```python
   def punctuation_removal(df):
       df['tweet'] = df['tweet'].str.replace('[^\\w\\s]','')
   ```

3. Advanced Processing:
   ```python
   def term_frequency(df):
       tf1 = (df['tweet']).apply(lambda x: pd.value_counts(x.split(" "))).sum(axis=0)
   ```

## Solution Explanation

### 1. Basic Feature Extraction

```python
def extract_basic_features(text):
    features = {
        'word_count': len(text.split()),
        'char_count': len(text),
        'avg_word_length': avg_word(text),
        'stopwords': count_stopwords(text),
        'hashtags': count_hashtags(text),
        'numerics': count_numerics(text),
        'upper_case': count_uppercase(text)
    }
    return features
```

### 2. Text Preprocessing

```python
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Lower case conversion
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Punctuation removal
    text = remove_punctuation(text)
    
    # Stop words removal
    text = remove_stopwords(text)
    
    # Tokenization
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    
    return tokens
```

### 3. Advanced Feature Engineering

```python
def engineer_features(text, method='tfidf'):
    if method == 'tfidf':
        vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
        features = vectorizer.fit_transform([text])
    elif method == 'hashing':
        vectorizer = HashingVectorizer(n_features=1000)
        features = vectorizer.transform([text])
    return features
```
